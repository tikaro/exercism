# Exercism
My repository for working on Exercism exercises.  

I prefer to do exercises locally instead of in the browser-based editor because I find a lot of value in learning how to run the test harness.

Though "Locally" in this case means "in a GitHub Codespace", so that's stretching the concept of "local" pretty far.
